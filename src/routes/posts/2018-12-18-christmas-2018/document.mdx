<h5>
We hope this letter finds our dear ones safe, happy, and loved
</h5>

2018 was a bit less eventful than previous years. We are still living in the Avenues of SLC, and loving our neighborhood. We continue to love our church assignment to serve in an assisted-living care facility, and find great joy there.  

Jake is pushing through his chemical engineering degree at the University of Utah, and working part-time for Delta Airlines. Heather is still working for UofU Health, but in a new role with the Community Physician Group. She just finished up her third year of teaching with the Italian Club of Salt Lake, and will be taking a break from those classes, at least for the first semester of next year. Heather continues to enjoy freelance writing, and had three articles published with Outdoor Sports Guide Magazine. This year, we rock climbed a lot more, tried to get to bed earlier, and Jake spent the summer working on an impressive carpentry project: he built us a new bed!

Our day-to-day hasn’t changed much as we’re in a school and work routine, so we have to add a sprinkle of fun in there to keep life interesting.  

This year, our adventuring took us climbing, hiking, biking, cross-country skiing, fishing, and on many more incredible experiences. We skied to a backcountry yurt in Utah, hiked to remote hot springs in Idaho, and visited friends and family in Texas, Oklahoma, California, Oregon, Maryland, Georgia, and across Utah. We watched a concert on the steps of the US Capitol building, went fishing on the Chesapeake Bay, saw a Broadway show in New York, ate waffles in Belgium, spent the night in a castle in Luxembourg, rode bikes in Amsterdam and through the windmills of Kinderdijk, played in the waves on the Gulf Coast, hiked and rock climbed in Moab a couple of times, and did lots of other hiking and camping trips in between. We even ran a half marathon and a 10K together. Life continues to be especially good to us.

We are looking forward to meeting 2019 with snowboarding season passes in hand, some adventure plans already brewing, and one another by our side. If you are reading this, that means you are dear to us and we’d love to see you soon! If you are traveling through Salt Lake City, please give us a shout out.

<h5>MERRY CHRISTMAS, AND A HAPPY AND HEALTHY 2019 TO YOU AND YOURS</h5>
