This year we embarked on our biggest adventure yet&#8212;Max Christopher was born on May 29th, and we are absolutely smitten with him. He had a couple of serious congenital heart defects, spending his first week in the cardiac ICU at Primary Childrenâ€™s Hospital, and later having a heart surgery in July. But now he is happy and healthy, and adored by everyone he meets. At 7 months old now, he is quick to smile, army crawls, is great at sitting up, and is having fun with trying table foods.  

In many ways, things look the same for us: same home, same jobs, same church calling, and many adventures dialed down due to the ongoing pandemic. But through it all, we have a bit of magic along with us in our boy. He really is a delight. 

<h5>
We hope you all are doing well, and we send you love and best wishes for this new year.
</h5>

Jake, Heather, and baby Max
