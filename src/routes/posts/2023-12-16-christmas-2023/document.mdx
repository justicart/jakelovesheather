This year felt quieter and calmer than those before as we've settled into a bit of a routine. We are still living in SLC, working our same jobs, and enjoying every new phase with Max.

Max is sweet, brave, energetic, and fun. He loves Mickey Mouse, Bluey, kicking and playing with balls, swimming, and being outside. He is talking so much and is developing a fun sense of humor and quick wit.

Though the logistics can be harder these days, we still try to prioritize travel and adventure. We spent a week in Ireland seeing the sights in Dublin and road-tripping around the countryside while Max stayed at home and was spoiled by his aunts and grandma. Heather had an unforgettable experience sailing the coast of Croatia with 8 other women on a 48' catamaran. The three of us celebrated our 12th anniversary together in Mexico where we played in the pool every day, swam with a Dolphin named Nemo, and made sand castles on the beach. We went on shorter trips to Disneyland in California and Disneyworld in Florida to meet some of Max's favorite characters, and a weekend trip to Waco to watch the Utes play the Bears.

We look forward to more adventures and time together in the coming year.

<h5>WE WISH YOU ALL PEACE AND LOVE THIS HOLIDAY SEASON AND IN THE NEW YEAR.</h5>
