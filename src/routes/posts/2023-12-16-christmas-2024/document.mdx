2024 has been another wonderful year, with Max retaining his spot at the center of our universe.

We rang in the new year in Zion National Park with family, and celebrated Valentine's Day together in
Disneyland. Throughout the year, we had other fun trips to Oklahoma, Texas, North Carolina, Georgia,
and Hawaii. We celebrated Jake's 40 th birthday with friends and family at a party in Utah, and on a cruise
in Alaska where we hiked, panned for gold, and saw humpback whales.

Max is still energetic, sweet, and so fun. He will quickly tell you that his favorite animals are cows,
sharks, and kitties, and his favorite colors are red and white. He looks forward to his weekly swimming
lessons, and is becoming quite comfortable in the water. He is learning his letters, and can write his
name. Though it's bittersweet, we love watching him grow.

<h5>We wish you all the very best for 2025, and hope you each feel love and light this holiday season and in
the new year.</h5>
