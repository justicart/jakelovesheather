4/25 - I can't believe we're down to only 52 days til the wedding - Crazy! So far, everything is moving pretty smoothly and we're just continuing to get everything ready. We'll be sending out our invitations in the next couple of weeks, so if you could please email your current mailing address to Jake or Heather, we'd appreciate it. (You can find our email addresses in the "contact us" tab.)

Oh, and I thought that after the last desperate post, we should update you on that trip. After 3 days of being stuck in Washington, we finally made it home. It was quite the adventure! The engagement photos that we went up there for turned out to be fantastic! We worked with the incredibly talented Megan from Easy Dreamer Photography and she just posted a few photos from the session on her blog. Check them out! http://blog.easydreamerphotography.com
