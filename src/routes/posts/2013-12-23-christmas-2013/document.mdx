We originally created this website when we were engaged so that we could have a place to direct people for wedding info.  Looking at all of these old photos of us is nostalgic, but maybe we should update it to more current photos.  Stay tuned for that one…

We saw the clock turn to midnight, starting off 2013, in an airport bus.  We were headed on an adventure to South America to hike Machu Picchu with our friends Steve & Traci.  We had a blast exploring the town of Cusco, and seeing the ancient ruins.  They were stunning!  Our travels this year also took us to Texas twice to visit Jake’s family there, to Florida for a conference with Heather’s family, and to Louisianna multiple times to visit and help Heather’s dad, and to tour New Orleans.




Heather is still working at both Williams Sonoma in trolley square, and at the Marriott Residence Inn in downtown Salt Lake.  She keeps a busy schedule working part-time and going to school full-time.  In April she graduated with an Associates in General Studies from LDS Business College.  After taking the summer off to work and relax, she resumed her undergraduate coursework in the fall at the University of Utah.  She is studying English and Writing, and hopes to graduate in the spring of 2015.  Heather has enjoyed running for a few years now, but in 2013 she really became an enthusiast.  She trained for and completed the Ragnar Wasatch Back in June, the Haunted Half Marathon in October, and the Ragnar Las Vegas in November.




Jake is still working at Delta Airlines, and likes the work there.  After being diagnosed with Ulcerative Colitis in the summer of 2012, his condition didn’t get better in 2013.  His doctors tried every treatment they could to get his symptoms under control, including tons of prescription drugs, painful shots at home, and lengthy infusion treatments at an infusion center.  It was so frustrating, because nothing seemed to work!  Finally in October, his specialists decided that surgery was the only option left, so he went in for a Full Abdominal Colectomy with End Ileostomy on October 17th.  It was a major surgery but, in true Jake fashion, he did amazingly well, and his recovery was speedy.  He was off of work for about 6 weeks to heal, and is now back at Delta on ‘light duty’.  Three weeks after surgery he felt well enough to travel to Las Vegas to cheer Heather and her team on at the Ragnar relay race.  He has two more surgeries to go through next year, so definitely keep him in your prayers.  He is feeling so much better than he has in a long time, and we’re hoping for a full recovery so that he can get back to his crazy, fun-loving self.




We certainly hope that all of our loved ones reading this are happy and well.  We wish you the absolute best for the coming year.

All our love,

-Jake & Heather
