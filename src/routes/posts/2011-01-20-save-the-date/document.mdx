January, 2011: Our "Save the Date" cards are out in the mail!   (phew, check one thing off of the list.) We will still be sending out invitations, but those probably won't come until April or so.  Since we have so many friends and family out of state, we thought we'd give a heads up to those who need more time to plan travel arrangements.  So mark it on your calendars for June 16th, 2011.   The  ceremony will be performed in the Salt Lake LDS temple, with a reception to follow afterward.  We are so excited for our special day and hope that you can all share it with us!
