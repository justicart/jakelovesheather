We hope everyone had a lovely Christmas holiday!  Heather had to work til 6pm on Christmas Eve at Williams Sonoma and Jake was sick with tonsillitis. So that night we had a relaxing candlelit dinner, exchanged gifts between the two of us and watched a movie – pretty low key.  The next morning we drove up to Heather's parents house to spend Christmas with her family. What a wonderful weekend spent with loved ones.  We are back in Salt Lake now and getting ready to head down to Vegas for New Years Eve! Party!...
