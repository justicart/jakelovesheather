<h5>
ANOTHER YEAR IS COMING TO A CLOSE, AND WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOU. YES, YOU. IF YOU ARE READING THIS, WE LOVE YOU AND HOPE YOU ARE WELL.
</h5>

Not many things changed for us this year, but hereâ€™s a snapshot of our life:

**US**

Same apartment, same jobs, same church calling. This year we snowboarded, cross-country skied, backpacked, swam in waterfalls, road-tripped, biked, visited 2 national parks, rock-climbed, hiked, attended a few weddings, visited friends and family, camped, went to work, watched all 8 seasons of GoT, started watching The Great British Baking Show (fewer deaths, less blood), did homework, and spent a million moments in between doing regular things, and doing them together. We rang in the new year in San Francisco and will be saying goodbye to 2019 in Abu Dhabi, UAE.

**JAKE**

Still studying chemical engineering at UofU, still working for Delta. Sent his first of many multi-pitch climbs. Accomplished a 7-day liquids-only fast (not sure why he would do such a crazy thing).

**HEATHER**

Still working for UofU Health. Started attending school very part-time, pursuing a TESOL certificate from the UofU Linguistics department. Traveled with friends to Cuba. Set a new personal record of camping 14 nights in the year.

<h5>
WE WISH YOU ALL PEACE, COMFORT, AND HAPPINESS THIS HOLIDAY SEASON, AND ALL OF THE BEST FOR THE COMING YEAR.
