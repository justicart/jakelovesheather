2022 has been a good year. We've gotten more sleep than we did during Max's newborn months, and are having so much fun with him as he grows and develops.

Max learned how to walk in April, and has become a fast-moving, curious wild animal. It's fun and exhausting keeping up with him. He started going to a daycare/child development center in the fall, spending two days a week playing with friends, doing arts and crafts, and learning new things.

Jake is still working for Delta at the SLC airport, and loves spending lots of time with Max while Heather works during the day.

Heather shifted her career this year, taking a role as a Strategic Communications Manager with Marketing & Communications for UofU Health. She has enjoyed returning to her roots with writing and content creation.

In October, we took Max to Italy to celebrate our engagement there in 2010. We had planned to go in 2020, but the events of the last two years delayed our plans. It was so fun taking our boy to the spot where we became engaged, and we enjoyed the sights, sounds, and flavors of Venice together.

We wish you all a bright and merry Christmas, and hope we can connect soon.
