  spoiler: "We saw the clock turn to midnight, starting off 2013, in an airport bus.  We were headed on an adventure to South America to hike Machu Picchu with our friends Steve & Traci.  We had a blast exploring the town of Cusco, and seeing the ancient ruins.  They were stunning!  Our travels this year also took us to Texas twice to visit Jake’s family there, to Florida for a conference with Heather’s family, and to Louisianna multiple times to visit and help Heather’s dad, and to tour New Orleans.",
